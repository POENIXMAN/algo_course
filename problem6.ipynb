    "To determine the day with the maximum number of guests in the hotel at the same time, you can use a *sweep line algorithm* (or an *interval counting* technique). Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert Each Date to Events**:\n",
    "   - For each stay (a tuple with a check-in and check-out date), create two events:\n",
    "     - **Check-in event** on the check-in date.\n",
    "     - **Check-out event** on the day after the check-out date (to indicate the guest leaves after the last night).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Store Events in a List and Sort**:\n",
    "   - Create a list of all events (both check-ins and check-outs).\n",
    "   - Each event should be represented as `(date, +1)` for check-ins and `(date, -1)` for check-outs.\n",
    "   - Sort this list of events by date. In case of ties (same date), prioritize check-out events over check-in events to handle cases where guests leave and arrive on the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perform a Sweep Line Count**:\n",
    "   - Initialize two counters: `current_guests` (to track the current number of guests) and `max_guests` (to store the maximum number of guests found).\n",
    "   - Traverse the sorted list of events. For each event:\n",
    "     - If it’s a check-in, increase `current_guests` by 1.\n",
    "     - If it’s a check-out, decrease `current_guests` by 1.\n",
    "     - Update `max_guests` and store the date whenever `current_guests` exceeds `max_guests`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - After processing all events, `max_guests` will contain the maximum number of guests, and the associated date(s) will be the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "For input:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stays = [(\"2024-09-15\", \"2024-09-15\"), (\"2024-09-14\", \"2024-09-21\")]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events generated:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  events = [(\"2024-09-14\", +1), (\"2024-09-15\", +1), (\"2024-09-16\", -1), (\"2024-09-22\", -1)]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- After sorting:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  events = [(\"2024-09-14\", +1), (\"2024-09-15\", +1), (\"2024-09-16\", -1), (\"2024-09-22\", -1)]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process each event with a sweep line:\n",
    "  - On `2024-09-14`, `current_guests = 1`.\n",
    "  - On `2024-09-15`, `current_guests = 2` (update `max_guests` to 2).\n",
    "  - On `2024-09-16`, `current_guests = 1`.\n",
    "  - On `2024-09-22`, `current_guests = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: The maximum number of guests, 2, was on `2024-09-15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to sorting, and it’s straightforward to implement."
